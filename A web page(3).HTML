                <p>A web page is a digital document that is accessible through a web browser and displayed on a user's device. It's a fundamental unit of content on the World Wide Web and is used to present information, media, and interactive elements to users.</p> 
                <p>Here's a more detailed explanation of web pages:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><b><font color="red">HTML Markup:</font></b> <font color="cyan"> Web pages are created using HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), which is a standardized markup language used to structure content on the web. HTML provides a way to define headings, paragraphs, lists, images, links, forms, and other elements that make up the content of a web page.</font></li>

                <li><b><font color="red">Content Elements:</font></b> <font color="cyan"> A web page can include a wide variety of content elements, such as:</font></li>
                    <ul type="square"> 
                    <li><b><font color="sky blue">Text:</font></b> This includes headings, paragraphs, lists, and other textual information.</li>
                    <li><b><font color="sky blue">Images:</font></b> Graphics and pictures can be embedded in a web page to enhance visual appeal and convey information.</li>
                    <li><b><font color="sky blue">Hyperlinks:</font></b> Links allow users to navigate to other web pages, documents, or external resources.</li>
                    <li><b><font color="sky blue">Multimedia:</font></b> Audio and video elements can be added to web pages to provide a richer experience.</li>
                    <li><b><font color="sky blue">Forms:</font></b> Web pages can contain forms for user input, such as contact forms, search boxes, and login fields.</li>
                    <li><b><font color="sky blue">Interactive Elements:</font></b> JavaScript and other scripting languages enable the creation of interactive features like animations, sliders, and real-time updates.</li>
                    <li><b><font color="sky blue">Styling:</font></b> CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to control the layout, colors, fonts, and overall visual presentation of a web page.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li><b><font color="red">Structure:</font></b> <font color="cyan"> A typical web page consists of various sections, including a header (containing a logo, navigation links, etc.), a main content area, and a footer (containing copyright information, contact details, etc.). These sections help organize and structure the content for better user experience and readability.</font></li>
                <li><b><font color="red">Responsive Design:</font></b> <font color="cyan"> Modern web pages are often designed to be responsive, meaning they adapt and display properly on different devices and screen sizes, from smartphones and tablets to desktop computers. This ensures a consistent and user-friendly experience across various platforms.</font></li>

                <li><b><font color="red">Browser Rendering:</font></b> <font color="cyan"> When a user enters a web page's URL or clicks on a link, their web browser sends a request to the corresponding web server. The server responds by sending the HTML and other resources (like CSS and JavaScript files) that make up the web page. The browser then renders these resources to display the web page as intended.</font></li>

                <li><b><font color="red">Web Page Lifecycle:</font></b> <font color="cyan"> A web page has a lifecycle that includes loading, rendering, user interaction, and potential dynamic updates. JavaScript can be used to enhance user interactivity and enable dynamic changes to the content without requiring a full page reload.</font></li>

                <li><b><font color="red">Web Technologies:</font></b> <font color="cyan"> Web pages are built using a combination of technologies, including HTML for content structure, CSS for styling, JavaScript for interactivity, and various other tools, libraries, and frameworks for more advanced features.</font></li>

                <li><b><font color="red">Accessibility:</font></b> <font color="cyan"> It's important for web pages to be designed with accessibility in mind, ensuring that people with disabilities can access and interact with the content. This involves providing alternative text for images, using semantic HTML, and adhering to accessibility guidelines.</font></li>
            </ol>
<p>Overall, web pages are the building blocks of the World Wide Web, allowing individuals and organizations to share information, communicate, and conduct business on a global scale. The design and development of web pages play a crucial role in delivering a positive user experience and achieving various online goals.</p>

				<p>A website is a collection of related web pages and multimedia content that are grouped together under a common domain name. Websites are accessible over the internet and are designed to provide information, offer services, entertain, or facilitate various types of interactions.</p>

For example, "www.example.com" is a domain name. It typically consists of two parts: the top-level domain (TLD) and the second-level domain (SLD). Common TLDs include .com, .org, .net, and country-specific TLDs like .uk or .ca.</font></li>

                <li><b><font color="red">Web Pages:</font></b> <font color="cyan"> A website is composed of individual web pages.

                <li><b><font color="red">Navigation:</font></b> <font color="cyan"> Websites include a navigation system that helps users move between different web pages within the site. This navigation can take the form of menus, links, buttons, or other elements that provide a user-friendly way to explore the content.</font></li>

                <li><b><font color="red">Home Page:</font></b> <font color="cyan"> The home page is the main entry point of a website. It's the first page users see when they visit the domain.

                <li><b><font color="red">Content Types:</font></b> <font color="cyan"> Websites can serve a variety of purposes and provide different types of content. Some common types of websites include:</font></li>

                    <li><b><font color="sky blue">Responsive Design:</font></b> With the increasing use of mobile devices, websites need to be designed to work well on different screen sizes. Responsive design ensures that the layout and content of a website adapt to various devices, providing a consistent user experience.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li><b><font color="red">Web Hosting:</font></b> <font color="cyan"> Websites need to be hosted on web servers so that they are accessible to users. Web hosting services provide the infrastructure and technologies necessary to keep websites operational and responsive.</font></li>
